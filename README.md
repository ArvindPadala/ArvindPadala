# Building scalable intelligence from raw data.

I focus on the intersection of statistical rigor and software engineering, where academic models meet production constraints. I believe robust ML systems should be boring: reliable, observable, and built on a foundation of clean data rather than complex hacks.

## Currently
- Designing retrieval systems that reason over unstructured enterprise knowledge base.
- Researching efficient fine-tuning methods for domain-specific small language models.
- Building event-driven architectures for low-latency real-time inference.

## How I Work
- Start simple, verify baselines, then iterate complexity.
- Code is a liability; keep it clean, modular, and minimal.
- Observability is not optional—if you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

## Interests
- Distributed systems
- Probabilistic modeling
- Computer vision
- MLOps infrastructure
